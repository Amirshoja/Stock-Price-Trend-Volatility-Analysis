# Contributing to the Stock Price Trend Volatility Analysis Project

This outlines how to propose a change to the Stock Price Trend Volatility 
Analysis project. We welcome all contributions to this project.

### How to contribute

*  Always file an issue if you notice something that needs to be improve for the 
project, or if you come up with any good idea that you want us to apply to the
analysis. Please keep the content of the issue succinct and clear.
*  Furthermore, if you would like to contribute to a bug fix or additional analysis,
please fork the repo first, work on your fork repo, and then submit a pull request.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  New Python code should follow the [python PEP 8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
*  New R code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.
